## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Architecture
```
Data Sources → Power Query → Data Model → DAX Calculations → Visualizations → Power BI Service
```

### Key DAX Measures
```dax
-- Campaign ROI Calculation
Campaign_ROI = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Revenue] - [Total Campaign Cost],
    [Total Campaign Cost],

) * 100

-- Cost Per Lead
Cost_Per_Lead = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Campaign Cost],
    [Total Leads Generated],
    0
)

-- Conversion Rate
Conversion_Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Conversions],
    [Total Leads],
    0
) * 100

-- Campaign Effectiveness Score
Campaign_Effectiveness = 
([Campaign_ROI] * 0.4) + 
([Conversion_Rate] * 0.3) + 
([Lead_Quality_Score] * 0.3)
```
